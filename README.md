Playground for a few random Cursor ideas I'll get

## âœ… Project Organization Complete

**Repository Structure:**
```
cursor-playground/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Main project overview
â””â”€â”€ projects/
    â””â”€â”€ rss-reader/             # RSS Reader project
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project-specific documentation
        â”œâ”€â”€ setup.md            # Setup instructions
        â”œâ”€â”€ backend/            # Flask API server
        â””â”€â”€ frontend/           # Vue.js frontend
```

**What's been committed:**
- âœ… Complete RSS Reader application (16 files, 1,168 lines)
- âœ… Organized project structure for future scalability
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Set up the RSS Reader:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/rss-reader
   # Follow setup.md instructions
   ```

2. **Future Projects:** You can now easily add new projects to the `projects/` directory without cluttering the main repo

3. **Ready for Development:** The RSS reader is ready to run once you set up PostgreSQL and install dependencies

The playground is now perfectly organized for your startup idea experiments! Each project will have its own folder, making it easy to manage multiple ideas in one repository. When one takes off, you can easily extract it into its own repo.

Would you like to set up the RSS reader now, or shall we start working on another project idea?
