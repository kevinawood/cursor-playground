## What Problem Does It Solve?

### The Challenge
- **Information Overload**: Too many news sources, too little time
- **Scattered Content**: Articles spread across different websites
- **Decision Fatigue**: Hard to choose what's worth reading
- **Time Management**: Need to quickly assess article value

### The Solution
- **Centralized Reading**: All articles in one place
- **Smart Summaries**: AI-powered article summaries
- **Reading Time Estimates**: Know how long articles will take
- **Bookmarking**: Save interesting articles for later
- **Clean Interface**: Focus on content, not distractions

---

## How It Works (In Plain English)

### 1. The Data Collection Process

**Think of it like a smart newspaper delivery service:**

- **RSS Feeds**: These are like "subscription lists" that websites provide. When a website publishes a new article, it automatically sends a notification to our system.
- **Background Processing**: Our system runs a "checking service" every few minutes that visits all your subscribed websites to see if there are new articles.
- **Smart Storage**: When new articles are found, they're stored in our database with all the important information (title, link, description, when it was published).

**Real-world analogy**: It's like having a personal assistant who reads all your favorite magazines and newspapers, then creates a custom digest just for you.

### 2. The User Experience

**When you open the application:**

1. **Dashboard View**: You see all your articles organized by feed (like having different sections of a newspaper)
2. **Article Cards**: Each article is displayed as a card showing:
   - Title and description
   - Which source it came from
   - How long it will take to read
   - Whether you've read it or bookmarked it
3. **Smart Features**: 
   - Click "Summarize" to get a 2-3 sentence AI summary
   - See reading time estimates to plan your reading
   - Bookmark articles to read later

### 3. The Intelligence Layer

**AI-Powered Features:**

- **Smart Summaries**: When you click "Summarize," our system:
  - Visits the actual article webpage
  - Extracts the main content
  - Uses OpenAI's AI to create a concise summary
  - Saves the summary so it doesn't need to regenerate it

- **Reading Time Calculation**: Our system:
  - Analyzes the actual article content (not just the description)
  - Counts words and estimates reading speed
  - Provides accurate "5 min read" estimates

- **Hacker News Integration**: For articles from Hacker News:
  - Offers a choice between reading the article or viewing the discussion
  - Discussion threads often contain valuable insights and comments

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### The Three-Layer System

**Frontend (What Users See)**
- Built with Vue.js (a modern web framework)
- Responsive design that works on phones and computers
- Real-time updates without page refreshes
- Caches data to work faster

**Backend (The Brain)**
- Built with Flask (a Python web framework)
- Handles all the business logic
- Manages the database
- Communicates with external services (AI, RSS feeds)

**Database (The Memory)**
- Stores all articles, feeds, and user preferences
- Built with PostgreSQL (a reliable database)
- Handles thousands of articles efficiently

### How They Work Together

1. **User opens the app** → Frontend loads and asks backend for articles
2. **Backend responds** → Sends article data from database
3. **User clicks "Summarize"** → Frontend asks backend to get AI summary
4. **Backend processes** → Scrapes article, calls AI service, returns summary
5. **User bookmarks article** → Frontend tells backend to save preference
6. **Backend updates database** → Marks article as bookmarked
