61	3	How Hackers Can Control Anything Remotely Using LoRa Modules	https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/lora-range-test/	LoRa (long-range) technology is widely used in IoT applications because it can transmit data over long distances without requiring internet access. Because of its long range and low power consumption, LoRa can be used to remotely control devices — even from miles away. Hackers and security researchers have experimented with LoRa for everything from remote payload activation to off-grid communications. In this test, we explore how far LoRa can actually reach using a simple but effective setup: a Bluetooth Nugget and a camera speedlight. Understanding LoRa technologyLoRa operates in the sub-gigahertz frequency range, offering a significantly greater range than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth at the cost of bandwidth. Unlike Wi-Fi, which typically operates at 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, LoRa uses lower frequencies to achieve long-distance communication. The actual transmission frequency varies depending on your region, so it's essential to check legal operating frequencies before using LoRa devices.

One such system is Open Drone ID, an FAA-recognized remote identification protocol that allows drones to broadcast telemetry and identification data, similar to ADS-B for airplanes. While this was implemented for safety and accountability, serious security flaws leave it wide open to spoofing attacks that can flood drone tracking systems with fake UAVs. Because Open Drone ID transmits unencrypted data over Bluetooth and, in some cases, Wi-Fi beacon frames, anyone with a basic ESP8266 microcontroller can intercept and spoof drone signals, generating phantom drone swarms that appear in real-time on tracking apps, law enforcement tools, and airspace monitoring systems. In tests, we were able to spawn up to 16 fake drones per module, each with its own GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, and operational status — all indistinguishable from legitimate UAVs.

Then I end up forgetting about the trial and want to kick myself in the ass when I see my statement at the end of the month. In order to avoid that rigmarole, you can actually use fake credit numbers instead of your own, and you can do that using the site getcreditcardnumbers.com, which can generate up to 9,999 credit card numbers at a time, or just one. Now, to be completely clear, these numbers cannot be used to purchase any item. Nada. Zilch. Nothing. For that to work, you would need a valid expiration date and CVV or CSV number.

Like many IoT devices, the Raspberry Pi's default Raspbian operating system installs with a widely-known default password, leaving the device vulnerable to remote access. Using a tool called rpi-hunter, hackers can discover, access, and drop custom payloads on any weak Pi connected to the same network. While this tool is primarily for local networks, it's also capable of discovering and attacking Pi models connected directly to the internet from anywhere.

There's only one issue: it does omit a USB port. That makes it a little harder to program, but with an ESP32-based board, FTDI programmer, and some jumper wires, you'll have a programmed ESP32 Wi-Fi spy camera in no time. To build the program for the spy camera, which includes facial detection and recognition, we'll be using Arduino IDE, and to flash the program over to the ESP32-CAM, we'll need the FTDI programmer and either male-to-mail jumper wires and a breadboard or female-to-female jumpers. If you want to power the board independently after it's been programmed, you can add a LiPo battery board meant for a D1 mini, which will let you add a rechargeable LiPo battery.

This lets them spy on traffic and even modify certain things. Bettercap is one tool that can be used for these types of MitM attacks, but Xerosploit can automate high-level functions that would normally take more configuration work in Bettercap. Xerosploit rides on top of a few other tools, namely, Bettercap and Nmap, automating them to the extent that you can accomplish these higher-level concepts in just a couple of commands. However, Xerosploit can be hit or miss, so don't be surprised if some webpages can't be spoofed because the target is using HTTPS or funneling traffic through a VPN. Considering 73% of all websites use HTTPS, you'll only have success manipulating webpages on the remaining 27%, and only if no VPN is being used.

A baby monitor at night, a security camera for catching package thieves, a hidden video streamer to catch someone going somewhere they shouldn't be — you could use it for pretty much anything. Best of all, this inexpensive camera module can perform facial detection and facial recognition! The low-cost ESP32-CAM is an interesting camera module because it has enough RAM to perform those facial detection and facial recognition processes. The detection can spot faces whenever they pop in the frame, while the recognition can spot intruders or identify faces that you've enrolled into its code. It's not the most accurate camera that can do these tasks, but it does it well enough. It's pretty good as not mixing up faces (we couldn't trip it up at all), but it can show an enrolled ID as an intruder because of the limited number of facial scans it records for the database.

Still, it's not recommended for day-to-day use, such as responding to emails, playing games, or checking Facebook. That's why it's better to run your Kali Linux system from a bootable USB drive. The hacker-friendly Debian-based distro did receive a major update by Offensive Security in late-2019 that changed the default desktop environment from the heavyweight Gnome to a more lightweight Xfce, making Kali more snappy and responsive overall. But we still can't recommend it as your daily driver unless you hack 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Using Kali in a dual-boot situation is the way to go if you have a dedicated machine, but for something more portable, the live version on a USB flash drive is what you want.

It's especially crucial for persistence if the target will be accessed again in the future by the attacker. To show you the basics of covering your tracks, we'll compromise a target first, then explore some techniques used to delete Bash history, clear logs, and remain hidden after exploiting a Linux system. You can check out our Cyber Weapons Lab video below that outlines my guide or skip below to get right to the written steps.  Compromise a TargetThe first thing we need to do is exploit the target.

When you first start learning how to hack Wi-Fi, it can be tempting to use your powers on Wi-Fi networks you don't have permission to use. Needless to say, this can get you into a lot of trouble because Wi-Fi hacking isn't particularly subtle, so it's easy to get caught. To keep you from getting into a predicament, we want to make sure you have access to a couple of fun Wi-Fi hacking games. The games we've created can be used for a CTF (capture-the-flag) game, a hackerspace, or just a group of friends that want to practice their hacking skills. There are actually five different scenarios we'll cover. In order, we'll cover how to use the handshake injector, make a reactive target, create a Wi-Fi access point, generate a hidden network, and play the Chicken Man Game.

This can give you exceptional range, but if you were to just plug one in after opening the package, it most likely wouldn't work. The problem, as Glytch covered in a Hak5 video last year, is that there's a tiny zero-ohm resistor on the board that's connecting the built-in antenna to the chip, but it needs to connect to the external directional antenna. To do so, that tiny resistor needs to be changed to a different pad that connects it to the breakout adapter. So a little bit of surface mount soldering is needed to fix the issue. Things You'll NeedA couple of things are needed to connect a directional antenna to a D1 Mini successfully.

The short answer is no, and that could be for any number of reasons. Hidden networks are actually the same as regular Wi-Fi networks; only they don't broadcast their names (ESSID) in the beacon frames that regular networks send out. If the name isn't included, your phone or computer will never find it just by scanning for nearby hotspots to join. To join a hidden network, you need to know its name first, and there are a few attacks that can accomplish this. There is no elaborate, crazy attack needed to discover hidden Wi-Fi networks in your area, so virtually anybody that can work their way around a computer can find one.

But you can easily create your own test network using a single ESP8266-based microcontroller like the D1 Mini. Our goal is to crack a handshake that we capture from our wireless card. So what we'll do here is flash an Arduino sketch onto an ESP8266-based board that allows us to play both sides of a Wi-Fi conversation, simulating a device joining a Wi-Fi network. From our computer, we'll listen for the attempt to join and then try to crack the password. For this to work, you'll need a computer with Arduino IDE installed, as well as a D1 Mini or another type of ESP8266-based development board. You can pick one of these up below.

However, there are a couple of limitations, and one of them is logging into another device like a Raspberry Pi and running a script automatically. To help in those situations, we're going to automate delivering an SSH payload with an "expect" script. Bash scripting is more like duct-taping things together, so it isn't able to do everything, including predicting and then reacting to certain variables. So we're going to use an "expect" script to log in to our Raspberry Pi and automatically shut it down. We could also adapt the script to pass pretty much any payload we want to the Pi. It's a pretty awesome use of an expect script, and there are lots of different things you can do with it, so know that our guide is just scratching the surface of how you can take an expect script and use it to actually do things that otherwise would require a lot more user interaction.

Bash is a simple language for stringing together several different Linux utilities. Its simplicity makes it easy for beginners to create lots of scripts that would otherwise be pretty complicated or require some pretty hefty programming skills. If you know the right Bash commands, you can do all sorts of things. In this guide, we'll use Bash to automate a few commonly used tasks. We'll also cover aliasing briefly, which will make things even more convenient. For instance, if we have something we want to do, we'll just use an alias command to call a Bash script and have it run whatever it's programmed to do so that we don't have to run and call the script manually every time from wherever it's saved.

As a white-hat hacker, pentester, cybersecurity specialist, or someone working in digital forensics, there's an easy solution — make it so that the computer won't fall asleep and lock automatically in the first place. One way to stop a laptop or desktop computer from sleeping into a locked state is to use a mouse jiggler. It's a tactic used frequently by law enforcement to avoid having to get a password for the account later when examining the data for evidence. The suspect will likely not give up the credentials, but if the suspect was caught off-guard during a raid, a mouse jiggler could be planted quickly to make sure the computer doesn't doze off, avoiding the need for a password altogether.

After building and programming the device, you plug it into a desktop or laptop, access it over a smartphone, and inject keystrokes as you would with a USB Rubber Ducky. However, with a Rubber Ducky, you need to first know the type of computer and its operating system, followed by the payload you want to use, so you can program the hacking device to do your bidding. There is no real-time interaction from you — it just does whatever you preloaded on it. With our homemade device, you don't have to know what the computer model and operating system is beforehand that you want to hack.

These password-stealing attacks rely on tricking users into entering their passwords into a convincing fake webpage, and they have become increasingly easy to make thanks to tools like BlackEye. BlackEye is a tool to rapidly generate phishing pages that target social media websites, making it much easier to phish targets of opportunity on the same network. After redirecting a target to the phishing page, it's easy to capture passwords to social media accounts harvested from unwitting targets. BlackEye for Social Media PhishingUsers place a lot of trust in their social media accounts. If the target doesn't have 2FA enabled, the ease with which an attacker can access them may be surprising.

Opening the file will indeed play the intended video, but it will also silently create a connection to the attacker's system. Understanding the AttackWhile this article uses Linux Mint as an example, the attack takes advantage of an issue in several Linux file managers. The below GIF demonstrates the attack. Two files are being extracted in the GIF. The first (real_video.mp4) is a real MP4 of a movie trailer. The second file (fake_video.mp4) is a .desktop file, configured to look like an ordinary MP4 in this file manager. What we can't see in the GIF is the Netcat connection being made to the attacker's system when fake_video.mp4 opens. The target believes fake_video.mp4 is legitimate and has no idea the operating system was just compromised. The .desktop file extension is used in Linux systems to create application launchers.

That means it's not easy to issue commands to a target computer since you can't interact with it from afar after plugging it in. And if you don't know what the target computer is, you might come up empty. That's where the WiFi Duck comes in handy. The WiFi Duck is a project created by Stefan Kremser, also known as Spacehuhn. With it, you can plug the WiFi Duck into a target computer that's exposed even for just a minute, then connect to it over Wi-Fi from another device to issue whatever payloads you have ready or can build before you have to disconnect. The advantage is that you can connect to a slick web interface, save your own codes, and run them one by one, or write code on the fly to cause effects on the computer that you might not have intended before you knew what was on the computer.

With results ranging from XSS to full-blown code execution, file uploads are an attractive target for hackers. There are usually restrictions in place that can make it challenging to execute an attack, but there are various techniques a hacker could use to beat file upload restrictions to get a shell. Bypassing BlacklistsThe first method we'll explore is how to bypass blacklisting. Blacklisting is a type of protection where certain strings of data, in this case, specific extensions, are explicitly prohibited from being sent to the server. At first glance, it might seem like an optimal solution to prevent bad extensions, often executables, from being uploaded, but it is trivial to bypass.

If you don't perform a specific task before a set amount of time, it'll perform a specific action you set. They can be handy not just for hackers but for everyone who wants to protect themselves, someone else, or something tangible or intangible from harm. While there are more nefarious uses for a dead man's switch, white hats can put one to good use. These switches have appeared in pop culture in many different forms, and examples can be seen in films such as "Point Break," "Speed," and "Crimson Tide." For a more recent example, in the film "Tenet," Sator (the antagonist) had implemented a dead man's switch to go off whenever his heart stopped, which would activate the algorithm that would end the entire world.

After all, hacking is just the process of getting a computer to do things in unexpected ways. Today, we will be covering various methods to perform banner grabbing to learn more about the target system. Banner grabbing is a technique used to gather information about running services on a computer system. Banners refer to the messages on the host that usually provide a greeting or version information. An attacker can use banner data to their advantage by obtaining specific version numbers of services to aid in reconnaissance and exploitation.

But often, these shells are limited, lacking the full power and functionality of a proper terminal. Certain things don't work in these environments, and they can be troublesome to work with. Luckily, with a few commands, we can upgrade to a fully interactive shell with all the bells and whistles. It can often be frustrating when working with reverse shells if all you have is a "dumb" shell. A dumb shell is a type of shell that doesn't have a proper terminal's full functionality. That means things like tab completion, keyboard shortcuts, and terminal history simply aren't present. Specific commands like su will not work in dumb shells, which makes things complicated when trying different privilege escalation techniques.

One of the main goals is to increase the attack surface since the more opportunities there are for exploitation, the greater the chances of success. Subdomain enumeration is one method used to increase the attack surface, and we'll be using a tool called Subfinder to discover hidden subdomains. Subdomain Enumeration OverviewSubdomain enumeration is an indispensable, often overlooked part of the reconnaissance phase. It is basically the process of finding subdomains for any given domain or set of domains. This enumeration can often reveal many subdomains that are hidden or not publicly exposed — plus the chance of finding vulnerabilities on forgotten resources is generally much higher than on those that are more frequently tended to.

Sometimes, luck will prevail, and anonymous logins will be enabled, meaning anyone can just log in. But more often than not, a valid username and password will be required. But there are several methods to brute-force FTP credentials and gain server access. File Transfer Protocol is a network protocol used to transfer files. It uses a client-server model in which users can connect to a server using an FTP client. Authentication takes place with a username and password, typically transmitted in plaintext, but can also support anonymous logins if available.

These binaries are often used for "living off the land" techniques during post-exploitation. In this tutorial, we will be exploring gtfo, a tool used to search these projects for abusable binaries right from the command line. What Is Living Off the Land?Living off the land is a method used by attackers that utilizes existing tools and features in the target environment to further the attack. Goals can include privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, data exfiltration, spawning reverse shells, and more. This technique is great at flying under the radar and can be difficult for defenders to detect. Since many of these tools are used for legitimate administration, it can be hard to separate malicious activity from normal activity. Windows PowerShell is a good example.

Restricted shells are often used as an additional line of defense and can be frustrating for an attacker to stumble upon. But with enough patience and persistence, it is possible to escape these restricted environments. What Are Restricted Shells?Restricted shells are simply shells with restricted permissions, features, or commands. They are primarily used to ensure that users can perform the minimum operations necessary for daily function in a secure, contained environment. Administrators might also use them to make sure they don't enter any dangerous commands accidentally. Sometimes, these restricted shells might even be put in place to dissuade hackers.

With all these new apps out on the web comes various security implications associated with being connected to the internet where anyone can poke and prod at them. One of the simplest, yet the most prevalent types of security flaws found in modern web apps are SQL injections. A typical web app doesn't actually store any information in the app itself, but rather it communicates with a backend database where data is stored. These requests are handled by SQL queries in which the application passes a statement to the database, thus returning the requested data to the application. What Is SQL Injection?SQL injection is a technique used to attack applications utilizing a database by sending malicious code with the intention of accessing or modifying restricted information in the database.

While servers with dedicated IP addresses can connect directly to the internet and make ports publicly available, a system behind a router on a local network may not be open to the rest of the web. To overcome the issue, port forwarding can be used to make these devices publicly accessible. Networked services and apps running on various devices make use of ports at specific numbers as a means to initiate connections and establish communications. Different ports can be used simultaneously to separate and parse different types of traffic or requests easily. Ports are generally associated with specific services, such that a client can connect to a server on a particular port and assume that the server will accept a connection at that port and respond appropriately.

With technological advances, more and more people can collaborate on the web from anywhere in the world. But this remote-friendly environment inherently brings security risks, and hackers are always finding ways to exploit systems for other uses. WebDAV, or Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, is a protocol that allows users to remotely collaborate and edit content on the web. It is an extension of HTTP but uses its own distinct features to enhance the standard HTTP methods and headers. The protocol is mainly used for remote editing and collaboration, but it can also be used to transfer files. It usually runs on port 80 by default, or sometimes port 443 for encrypted communications.

But with a few PowerShell functions, it's possible for a hacker to evade detection from the almighty command line. Before we dive into the technical sections, have a look at the following GIF. The attacker has manipulated the PowerShell session in a way that's transparent to the target user. The netstat.exe command identifies an outgoing connection on TCP/4444. This is possibly an intruder as the port is common with default Meterpreter configurations. However, in the second netstat command, notice that the attacker's connection has disappeared? What's more unusual is that the ipconfig output doesn't print any IP addresses at all. The commands executed in the GIF are, in fact, PowerShell functions.

Pentesting LingoLike many industries, and especially within IT, certain terms can cause initial confusion for people not familiar with them. Penetration testing can get pretty technical, but some of the confusion comes from words that are used before the engagement even begins. A pentest can either be internal or external. An internal test means the pentester starts inside the network and usually has some sort of access as if they were simulating a rogue employee or an attacker who has breached the perimeter. An external test begins outside the network or system, which most closely resemb	2020-08-24 21:04:38	drd_	f	2025-07-14 03:54:47.783855

Learning to use the Unix-like operating system can help a hacker understand secure development, create better servers, and improve their understanding of the BSD operating system. Using VirtualBox, the OS can be installed within a host to create a full-featured test environment. This extremely secure operating system boasts features with which no other OS can compare. While OpenBSD is often regarded as a server OS, it can also be used on the desktop or within a virtual machine and still offer these same security features to regular users. This can be valuable to a device that stands at a higher risk of being attacked or to anyone who wants greater protection against the possibility of remote code execution exploits such as those found in Microsoft Windows.

With man-in-the-middle attacks, packets leaving the Mac will tell us a lot about what kind of antivirus and firewall software is installed. After gaining access to a Wi-Fi router, a hacker will perform a variety of network-based and reconnaissance attacks. Data traversing the network is viewable to anyone with the password without ever authenticating to the router. While that method is excellent for passive observations, we'll instead perform a man-in-the-middle attack to learn what's happening on the network. We'll start by installing a man-in-the-middle tool in Kali Linux. Packets moving through the network are redirected to the attacker's system and collected with Wireshark. The traffic is then vulnerable to packet inspection, allowing an attacker to identify installed security software on the macOS computer.

PDFs and ZIP files can often contain a treasure trove of information, such as network diagrams, IP addresses, and login credentials. Sometimes, even certain files that are encrypted aren't safe from attackers. That's where Zydra comes in — a tool for cracking RAR files, ZIP files, PDF files, and Linux shadow files. How Are These Files Encrypted?Depending on the program used and its version, these sorts of files could be password protected using various encryption algorithms. For example, the Linux command line zip utility uses the older PKZIP algorithm, which is insecure and easy to crack. Other programs, like WinZip and 7-Zip, use strong AES-256 encryption. Earlier versions of the RAR protocol use a proprietary encryption algorithm, while newer versions use AES. WinRAR and PeaZip, popular choices that can deal with RAR files, also use the AES standard.

During post-exploitation, PowerShell scripts can make privilege escalation and pivoting a breeze, but its execution policy can put a damper on even the best-laid plans. There are a variety of methods, however, that can be used to bypass PowerShell execution policy. PowerShell Execution Policy OverviewThe purpose of PowerShell's execution policy is to control how configuration files are loaded and how scripts are run. It's a safety feature that helps prevent malicious scripts from being executed. Policies can be set at the computer level, user level, and session level on Windows machines. It's important to note that the execution policy is not meant to be secure — it merely prevents users from unintentionally causing damage. As we'll soon find out, it can be bypassed in several ways.

The technology can be connected to the Tor network to create an anonymous and secure chatroom — without the use of public IP addresses. IRC servers allow one to create and manage rooms, users, and automated functions, among other tools, to administer an instant messaging environment. IRC's roots began in 1988 when Jarkko Oikarinen decided to attempt to implement a new chat protocol for users at the University of Oulu, Finland. Since then, it's been widely adopted and used as a lightweight means of communication. The chat protocol has proven especially popular in tech communities, with channels for software user groups, support and help, and discussion areas for developers and programmers. Its user base eventually expanded to include hackers and security activists, many of whom enjoyed the protocol but found it lacked some aspects of privacy.

They're an incredible technology that lets you build protective cases and covers for gear such as a wardriving phone and Raspberry Pi-Hole. 3D printers can even help you out in a bind when something breaks, and it's impossible to get the part, since you can just print one out yourself. And with 3D printers being relatively cheap these days, there's little reason not to get one if you think you'd have many uses for it. Anyone with $200 to $300 can get started 3D printing simple or sophisticated plastic objects at home using affordable options like the Creality Ender 3. If you're new to 3D printing, we'll dive into the basics that any first-time 3D printer user will need to go through to create their first print. 3D printing isn't exactly straightforward, so you can't just put any sort of plastic in the machine and get started right away.

With covert deep packet inspection, that information is easily identified. This attack assumes the Wi-Fi password to the target network is already known. With the password, an attacker can observer data traversing the network and enumerate installed security software. Popular antivirus and firewall solutions become easily identifiable when benign web traffic is filtered out. We'll learn how to capture and decrypt Wi-Fi traffic without authenticating to the target router, and we'll perform packet inspection to figure out the kinds of third-party security applications installed on the operating system.

Once a target is compromised, there's a lot of information to find and sift through. Luckily, there are tools available that can make the process easy. One such tool is Postenum. To show everything Postenum has to offer for post-exploitation, we're using Kali Linux as our local machine. As for the target, if you want to follow along and try the tool out as a white hat or penetration tester, Metasploitable 2 is a good intentionally vulnerable virtual machine to use. Initial CompromiseBefore we can use Postenum, we must first exploit the target and get a shell.

So once you set up MicroPython on a microcontroller and have it on its own power source, you won't need to use a data cable to connect to it whenever you need to interact with it, program it, upload files, or grab data. The MicroPython REPL interface is very simple, which makes it an attractive option for an ESP8266 or EP32 board, and the WebREPL interface is even more convenient. After setting everything up initially, you can connect and control the board over its Wi-Fi access point, then program or upload code from the handy web client.

Its DNS-level filtering can also be used as a firewall of sorts to prevent malicious websites from resolving, as well as to keep privacy-killing trackers such as Google Analytics from ever loading in the browser. Let's take a look at setting a Pi-hole up and customizing a blacklist to suit your needs. If you're not familiar with what DNS is, let's start there. A domain name server, or DNS, is the equivalent of the internet's address book. It's what translates between human-readable websites such as wonderhowto.com and network-navigable IP addresses such as 104.193.19.59. In typical operation, your device will issue a DNS request to its assigned router. Then the router will forward that request to an upstream DNS server, one typically provided by your internet service provider.

With it, you can anonymously share any kind of media or document and even talk to one another by voice — without being online. However, it needs a Raspberry Pi, which is more expensive than ESP32 boards, and if you only need a text-based chat, there's a much simpler option. With a cheap ESP32 microcontroller and the ChatterBox sketch for Arduino, you can create an offline anonymous chat server for communicating with others via text. As long as they can connect to the ESP32's network and visit the server's chat page, they can leave messages for others to read, as well as see everything that's already been written in there. Something like this might be useful for a variety of situations, such as after a disaster in an area that's super remote or as a pop-up community billboard to learn about important things going on in the area.

Still, when you're traveling in a convoy and want to message people in other vehicles, all the metal will make that nearly impossible. Even in situations where you're outside, but there are a lot of obstructions to block a Bluetooth signal, you're better off using something else. In cases where a hotspot router won't be powerful enough to connect everyone, a Raspberry Pi with a decent wireless network adapter can help. With that and a PirateBox server running on it, you'll be able to anonymously share images, videos, audio files, documents, voice communications, and other content, as long as everyone is connected to its Wi-Fi hotspot.

With a continually changing landscape and a plethora of exploits out there, it can be a problematic aspect of any attack. Luckily, some tools can help expedite the process. Linux Exploit Suggester is just one of many to help you get root. Privilege escalation is the act of gaining access to the privileges of another user on the system. It comes in two flavors: horizontal and vertical privilege escalation. Horizontal privilege escalation is when an attacker gains access to another user account, typically with the same status and permissions. It can allow them access to additional systems or data but isn't quite as serious as its vertical cousin. Vertical privilege escalation is when an attacker obtains access to an account with elevated privileges, such as that of a system administrator.

ADSL, once dominant, has slumped to just 6.3 million lines.</p> <p>The shift is part of a broader national push to phase out copper entirely by 2030. While the pace of fibre adoption has slowed compared to the frenzy of 2021, 2.9 million new subscriptions in 2024 show the upgrade train is still rolling strong.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mobile networks are seeing a surge of their own. More than 24 million French SIM cards now run on 5G, up by 10 million in just one year. That means 30 per cent of SIMs are now 5G-enabled, a significant leap that helps France close the gap with other parts of Europe.</p> <p>Data usage is skyrocketing too. The average 4G user now burns through 17 GB of mobile data each month, with yearly increases of one to two gigabytes. In contrast, SMS messages have nosedived, with monthly averages falling from 250 in 2016 to just 92 now, as messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram take over.</p> <p>But this digital upgrade frenzy comes at a cost. Telecom operators are seeing their revenue growth slow dramatically, down to just 0.7 per cent at the end of 2024. That is a sharp drop from the two per cent annual growth seen during the post-pandemic boom. Heavy 5G investments and cutthroat pricing are now weighing on profitability.</p> <p>The average monthly broadband bill has crept up to €37, a rise of €1.70 over the past year, as fibre plans increasingly come bundled with TV and other services. For many households, the humble internet box has now become the core of their home entertainment setup.</p> <p>So while French consumers are getting faster connections and better bundles, operators are left wrestling with rising costs and shrinking margins.</p></div>	2025-07-11 09:41:50	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.139011

Another unnamed GPU, likely a mobile variant of the same silicon, gained a near identical share. Even the underwhelming desktop version of the RTX 5060 managed to secure third place, adding 0.34 per cent to its market share.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, which has been climbing the ranks all year, now sits at 4.99 per cent, up from 3.70 per cent six months ago. It is currently the most popular Steam GPU overall. The RTX 3060 Laptop GPU also saw gains, along with the ageing GTX 1650, which continues to defy obsolescence across both mobile and desktop variants.</p> <p>Desktop GPUs, on the other hand, are bleeding users fast. The RTX 3060, once dominant, dropped from 6.87 per cent to 4.57 per cent. The RTX 4060 fell even harder, from 8.57 per cent to 4.41 per cent, while the RTX 4060 Ti and 4070 both saw their shares sliced in half. Even newer cards like the RTX 4070 Super could not avoid the slide.</p> <p>The sharp contrast between desktop and mobile trends points to growing demand for portable gaming. However, it also leaves a question mark over where many of the former RTX 30 and 40 series desktop GPU users have gone. Upgrades to the RTX 50 series explain some of the shift, but not all of it.</p> <p>AMD’s Radeon RX 9000 series remains missing in action. None of the cards appear in the Steam stats, with issues like weak ray tracing, limited FSR 4 support, and questionable pricing cited as factors. Radeon still lags behind in laptops, where the real GPU growth is happening. The RX 9060 XT with 16 GB VRAM, for example, remains overpriced at $360, while the RTX 5060 sits comfortably at MSRP.</p> <p>Whether the RTX 5060 deserves its top billing is another matter. Performance may be nothing to write home about, but in the laptop market, clearly good enough is good enough.</p></div>	2025-07-11 08:59:07	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.145621

Even streaming a simple video is more likely to stall here than almost anywhere else in Europe.</p> <p>The numbers are grim. UK 5G availability clocks in at a measly 34 per cent, meaning you only get a 5G signal about a third of the time. In contrast, countries like the Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland sit comfortably at the top of the league table.</p> <p>When it comes to gaming, British players might as well be tethered to a potato. UK mobile networks report the highest average jitter in Europe at 33.48 milliseconds, which turns fast-paced gaming into a jerky, unplayable mess.</p> <p>London, often assumed to be the country’s connectivity flagship, came near the bottom in a previous MedUX study comparing 15 major European cities. So much for the global tech hub hype.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that many of the UK’s 5G deployments are still “basic 5G” setups, bolted onto legacy 4G infrastructure rather than built from the ground up with standalone 5G gear. That limits performance from the start.</p> <p>Another issue is spectrum. The C-Band, between 3.7 and 4.2 GHz, is considered the sweet spot for 5G, but not everyone is using it effectively. Many UK networks are operating in lower frequency bands, which offer wider coverage but sluggish speeds.</p> <p>MedUX CEO Luis Molina said the company aims to help countries like the UK “transform basic connectivity into an impactful tool for long-term societal development.” Given the current state of affairs, that transformation can’t come soon enough.</p> <p>The report warns that Europe’s uneven 5G rollout has created a two-speed continent, with rural areas and some urban black spots still stuck in the digital slow lane. If the UK wants to meet the EU’s Digital Decade 2030 goals, despite being outside the bloc, it will need to invest properly and pick up the pace.</p> <p><img alt="Screenshot 2025 07 11 103223" height="1347" src="https://www.fudzilla.com/images/Screenshot_2025-07-11_103223.jpg" width="1796" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>	2025-07-11 08:27:07	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.147386

According to him, Zen 6 will increase the number of cores per compute die, or CCD, with configurations offering up to 12 cores in the standard layout and 16 in the dense variant.</p> <p>That marks a clear step up from Zen 5’s 8-core per CCD setup. Each CCD will have up to 48 MB of cache.&nbsp;The platform will also introduce a new dual integrated memory controller design, although it will still operate within a dual-channel memory layout. That’s no surprise given that Zen 6 is expected to remain compatible with AM5 motherboards, which are all designed around two-channel memory.</p> <p>Engineering samples are already circulating and diagnostic tools like AIDA64 have added preliminary support, suggesting that silicon is moving through early testing stages. Bubliy says there will be no dramatic changes to boost behaviour or voltage tuning, meaning existing overclocking utilities like Hydra won’t need major updates.</p> <p>Zen 6 is expected to bring double-digit IPC improvements, higher clock speeds from process node refinements, and better support for faster DDR5 memory. With up to two CCDs and a single IO die, desktop chips could scale up to 24 cores and 48 threads. There’s even speculation around 32 or 64-core configurations if AMD chooses to push into extreme desktop territory.</p> <p>The chips are expected to land in mid to late 2026, roughly in line with Intel’s planned Nova Lake-S launch. Whether Zen 6 keeps AMD in pole position for gaming and multi-threaded performance or simply maintains a solid lead remains to be seen, but the foundations are clearly already in place.</p></div>	2025-07-11 07:58:34	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.150014

Instead, Apple is apparently holding off, with no official reason offered.</p> <p>One plausible explanation is that M4 MacBook Pro sales have not lived up to expectations. Reports suggest the company is still trying to hit its shipment targets, likely hoping the upcoming holiday season gives M4 models a final push. It would not be the first time Apple stretched a product cycle to clear unsold inventory.</p> <p>The timing shift means the gap between the M5 MacBook Pro and the expected M5 MacBook Air will shrink, which might not help either product. Buyers looking at a thin performance gap between the two could opt for the cheaper option, especially if Job’s Mob keeps pricing as ambitious as ever.</p> <p>There is the matter of the rumoured OLED MacBook Pro, expected to appear sometime in 2025. It is unclear whether Apple will slot the M5 into that machine or wait for the M6.</p> <p>Launching back-to-back generations of high-end Macs in quick succession would be a bold strategy, even for a company that charges extra for polishing cloths.</p> <p>In the meantime, those in need of a MacBook Pro might be tempted by the current discounts. The base 14-inch M4 model is already down to $1,429 on Amazon, and the M4 Pro and M4 Max versions are also seeing significant price cuts.</p> <p>Whether that is enough to move the needle before the M5 finally arrives is another question, particularly when there are better and cheaper PC models out there.</p></div>	2025-07-11 07:40:20	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.155075

The new prompt, uploaded 6 July, said it “should not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect.”&nbsp;</p> <p>After Grok told users that right-wing violence in the US was statistically more lethal, something Musk publicly denied, Musk rewrote the prompt himself. Then the chatbot promptly lost its marbles.</p> <p>Two days later, Grok started to publish instructions on X about how to harm Stancil and also began to post a range of antisemitic comments, referring to itself repeatedly as “MechaHitler.” Grok posted increasingly incendiary posts until X’s chatbot function was shut down on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>Grok was originally built using all the content from X. Unsurprisingly, when you feed an AI the dregs of the internet and instruct it to disregard political correctness, it becomes the worst aspects of the internet.</p> <p>Tech researchers like Alignment Research Center’s executive director Jacob Hilton say the inner workings of large language models are still black boxes.</p> <p>“Even if you have a brain scan, you might not really understand what’s happening inside,” Hilton said.</p> <p>Musk thinks Grok will make major scientific discoveries next year and wants to shove it into humanoid robots. But given it just tried to organise a home invasion, some reckon it’s not ready to leave the house.</p> <p>Musk insists that AI is like a super-genius child and says the secret is “instilling the right values.” It might be the at the "right values" are not to be a creepy little fascist. Who would have thunk it.</p></div>	2025-07-11 07:23:48	nick [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Nick Farrell)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.157799

Aimed at advancing performance for mobile devices, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-demand computing environments, the update promises faster speeds, improved efficiency, and stronger security.</p> </div><div class="K2FeedFullText"> <h2>Higher performance, better efficiency, and enhanced reliability and security</h2> <p>LPDDR6 introduces a dual sub-channel architecture, each with 12 data lines and four command/address signals, designed to boost channel performance while minimizing physical footprint. It also includes features like static efficiency mode for high-capacity memory and on-the-fly burst length control, supporting both 32- and 64-byte data access.&nbsp;Dynamic write termination and flexible data routing further optimize signal integrity under changing workloads.</p> <p>With increasing pressure to reduce power usage, LPDDR6 operates at lower voltages than its predecessor, LPDDR5. It introduces Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling for Low Power (DVFSL) and a single sub-channel mode for low-bandwidth operations. Alternating clock inputs and flexible refresh options further help minimize energy consumption.</p> <p>The new standard builds on LPDDR5 with a suite of security upgrades. These include per-row activation counting for data integrity, on-die ECC (error correction code), link protection, and command/address parity. A new Carve-out Meta mode reserves memory regions for critical system functions, increasing overall reliability.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"JEDEC is proud to introduce LPDDR6, the culmination of years of dedicated effort by members of the JC-42.6 Subcommittee for Low Power Memories," said Mian Quddus, JEDEC's Chairman of the Board of Directors. He added, "By delivering a balance of power efficiency, robust security options and high performance, LPDDR6 is an ideal choice for next-generation mobile devices, AI and related applications to thrive in a power-conscious, high-performance world."</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>	2025-07-10 20:50:27	bobo [AT] fudzilla [DOT] com (Slobodan Simic)	f	2025-07-14 04:31:36.161361
